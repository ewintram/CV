Fascinated by the dynamic nature of the tech sector, I have transitioned from a career in creative industry operations to web development. Retraining as a developer has honed my systematic problem solving abilities that have grown from my background in design, mathematics and project management. Working in a business at the intersection of the digital and creative sectors fuelled my interest towards understanding the functionality behind engaging interactive design.

## Skills

#### Process development

During my degree, my design practice was process-driven, focusing on the testing of techniques and experimentation. This methodology has translated into my career through the implementation of processes across all areas of studio and project management. From streamlining financial systems to devising workflow approval processes on large-scale client projects, I maintained and improved these tools through analysis and review.


#### Diligence

Supporting the management of multiple contractors while at NewAngle, I constructed and managed a system of tracking the status of 385 digital exhibits through production on the largest new museum project in the world. I provided reports to the client and became the key resource to monitor progress and capture delays that would impact the critical path.


#### Adaptability

I have a proven record of adaptability, pushing the scope of my previous roles to become more involved in projects. At Central Saint Martins, I organised the conference launch of a new research centre for almost two hundred delegates, and subsequent quarterly seminars and workshops with international speakers. Following the departure of a team member, I took over project management of a scholarship fundraising initiative including an auction of prestigious college alumni's artworks.


#### Proactivity

As a result of my support roles to teams and projects, I am a perceptive and proactive colleague, spotting patterns and making predictions on improvements to working environments.

As a student at Makers Academy web development bootcamp I mentored two junior students which allowed me to reflect on my own learning whilst supporting them with the curriculum and experience.
